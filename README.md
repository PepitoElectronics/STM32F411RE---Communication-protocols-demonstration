# STM32F411RE
# Communication protocols demonstration
Low level register config for SPI/I2C/USART using MPU9250 ADXL345 and LCD I2C

Simple script to setup I2C SPI and USART on STM32F411 at very low level
Using only the registers adresses from STM and sensors - no HAL library
--> GET data from sensor and display it on LCD I2C 16x2
